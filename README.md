# Dotfiles

[This is a work in progress...]


## Overview

These are my dotfiles - my essential configuration for various tools that make
me productive on a \*nix machine.

Feel free to have a look around and see if there's something you like. An
attempt has been made to keep things very structured and most things are
explained with comments.

There's also a simple facility to install this setup on a system. Just follow
the instrutions below if you want to try it out for yourself.
(Dockerized container coming soon...)

[TODO]
